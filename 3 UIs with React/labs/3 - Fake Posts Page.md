# Lab 3: Fake Posts Page

Create a simple component that will show a list of posts from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

## Version 1

Use `axios` and React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to fetch data from this url: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`

## Version 2

Either write some CSS yourself or use a framework to make it look pretty.

## Version 3 (Extra Credit)

Add an input to your component and allow users to filter posts by their content. (Which is latin gibberish!)

* You'll need a new `useState` hook
* You'll need to use `Array.filter` to iterate over each post and only display ones that contain the text from the input field.
