# Lab 1: TodoList

Create a simple Todo List using a Component.

## Version 1

You'll need a few arrow methods on the component that'll allow you to interact with the components state:

* `addItem()` should push an item into array of items
* `removeItem()` should remove on an item from the array of items
* `toggleCompleted()` will allow you to toggle the completion of an item in the list

## Version 2

Create a component for both List and Item and pass the state of your app as props to them, *(Hint: You'll lift the state into the App component)*


## Version 3

Style this with either CSS or inline styles, try and create stateless functional components that you can use to semantically layout your styles.
