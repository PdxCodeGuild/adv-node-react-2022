# Lab 2: Simple Portfolio Website

Create a simple portfolio website (for yourself) using a CSS framework of your choice. You can write your own custom CSS, but note this can be time consuming!

**Here are some cool CSS libraries that integrate with react**:
* [Bulma](https://github.com/couds/react-bulma-components)
* [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce)



## Version 1
**Your website should have 2 pages (AKA components):**
  * A `Home` page which will have a brief introduction to who you are, a photo and list of projects or accolades
  * A `Contact` page with a simple form on it (this does not have to work at first)

Use `react-router-dom` to allow for navigation between the two components.

## Version 2
**Deploy your app to github-pages using the following [guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#github-pages-https-pagesgithubcom).**

## Version 3 (Extra Credit)
**Allow users to actually send emails to your email address from your contact form.**

Do this using `mailto` or by following this [guide](https://sheelahb.com/blog/how-to-send-email-from-react-without-a-backend/).
