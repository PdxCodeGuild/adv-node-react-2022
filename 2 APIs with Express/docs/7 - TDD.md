# TDD

**TDD** or **Test Driven Development** is a pattern for writing software. It encourages writing pieces of code (known as tests) to ensure the functionality of your software. **This should ideally happen before you write any of your production code!**

Now this sounds tedious *and that's because it is*. There's no doubt about it adding more complexity to your development process. **However** once software is tested properly you can be relatively certain it will work as expected. (Note the relatively part!) 

In this class we're not going to go full TDD (some people take this very seriously), however we will incorporate some styles and ideologies from it. As we've all seen from manually testing our APIs with HTTP Clients like Postman and Insomnia, this is clearly not an ideal way to test. That's where [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) will come to the rescue!
