# Lab 1: Magic 8 Ball

**Write an express API that will return the answers a magic 8 ball would normally give.**

1. Start a node project with `yarn`
2. Install express: `yarn add express`
3. Write 1 API endpoint that will return back a randomly chosen message as json.
```javascript
response.send({ response: "<magic8ball quote>" })
```
