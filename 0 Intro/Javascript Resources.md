# Javascript Resources


* [Flavicope's Guides](https://flaviocopes.com/page/ebooks/), specifically "The Javascript Handbook" is a great and extensive resource for learning JavaScript in general.
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is one most tried and true resources for pretty much anything web development related (although sometimes a little bit wordy). It has lots of documentation for Node as well!
