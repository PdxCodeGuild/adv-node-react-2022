## Setup Checklist

- Send me an email so I have your email address
- Create a Slack account (I'll send you an invite)
- Install Node, Yarn
- Install VSCode (or program of choice)


## Slack

Please send an email to `anthony@pdxcodeguild.com`, so I have your email address. I'll then send you an invitation to Slack. Slack is an instant-messaging app we'll use to communicate. You can install the Slack desktop app rather than use a browser tab if that's easier for you.


## Version Control: Git & GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is a popular VCS (version control system) we'll use in conjunction with [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will help us keep track of our source code, and give us a public place to show our work to others, like a programming portfolio. A repository is a collection of folders and files. GitHub hosts a copy of those files, and Git allows us to keep our local and remote repository synchronized.

Download and install Git and create a GitHub account.

## NodeJS & NPM

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) a scripting language based on Chrome's V8 engine and allows you to use Javascript on the server side.

## Yarn

Yarn is an alternative package manager for NodeJS which allows you to download 3rd party packages and programs you can run in the terminal. 
It's a drop in replacement for `npm` which ships with node.

`npm install --global yarn`


## VSCode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular text editor / extensible IDE used primarily for Javascript/Typescript development. It's written using electron and has a huge collection of plugins and themes. It ships with a set of tools to stream line development including code completion, module resolution, etc.

**It's strongly suggested you use VSCode since the instructor will be using that throughout the course. It will make it easier to follow along / learn neat tricks and tips.**
