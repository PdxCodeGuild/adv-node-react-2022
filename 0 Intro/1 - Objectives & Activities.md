- Communication skills, the ability to explain complex technical concepts in simple terms

## Activities

This course is a sling-shot into a professional full-stack web development career, it is immersive and pragmatic. We focus on understanding the principles in practice. Most of the class will consist of alternating between lectures, demos, and labs. While we're working on our labs, you're free to use the entirety of the space.

The class will use a repo for viewing docs, labs, and solutions. 

### Lectures & Demonstrations

The purpose of lectures is to introduce and explain a topic. Most lectures are followed by live demonstrations. Please do not distract yourself during lecture.

### Labs

Labs represent the bulk of the course work. Read the lab description, plan out a solution, and implement your solution in a corresponding directory in your class repository. Please label your solutions very clearly (lab01.ext) and split the different versions into different files (unless the advanced version is a direct extension of the last solution).

Lab solutions must perform the functionalities described in the lab description. Unless an advanced version of a lab is labeled 'optional', it is not optional. All assignments must be formatted, tested, and commented in order to be considered 'complete'. All assignments must be completed in order to complete the course.

Many labs will have optional versions, which include additional features you can complete if you have the time or the desire, and may require you to do additional research. Do not work on them until you are done with the basic version of the assignment. Advanced requirements will enable you to reach into the more advanced topics of the course, and will give you a deeper understanding of the language.

These labs are designed to build upon each other, and so are best completed in order. The purpose of these labs is to practice your ability to break down a problem and express solutions in code. 

Make an honest attempt before you ask for help on a lab. Look carefully at the error message and where in the code it's occurring. Look through the provided resources, look at previous labs, research the problem on google and stack overflow. If you're stuck after 15 minutes of review and research, please ask for help, either from another student, a TA, or the instructor.

Don't consider an assignment 'finished' until it's been thoroughly tested. Try many different inputs and verify the output. Check for 'edge' cases or unexpected user input. I'll review your solutions from time to time and verify that they successfully fit the requirements of the assignment. If they don't, you'll need to fix them.

Once you've finished a lab or a major portion of a lab, commit and push your work. Unless you have a good reason (the building's on fire), try to only commit working code.

##### Academic Honesty

Do not look at the solution or other students' solutions until you've finished the lab yourself. You're only inhibiting your own learning by doing so.

You are encouraged to use resources (docs, online, books, each other) to research solutions. If you copy code from the internet or a book, you must understand what it means and how it works. If you're not sure, look up the function in the docs, try running it with a variety of inputs, and try tweaking the syntax, throw in print statements to print the values of variables at different times, etc. You must also give credit where credit is due. This can be done simply as a comment crediting the author or as a link to the source.

You cannot use a single function which performs the entirety of the solution for you (we're having you do things the hard way as a learning endeavor).

I hope this clearly defines the line between academic honesty and academic dishonesty.


### Pair, Group, & Mob Programming

Occasionally we'll do [pair or group programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) for a lab. Ensure that neither of you is in control of the keyboard for the majority of the time. Regularly alternate roles between directing (talking about what needs to be done) and driving (actually typing).

For [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming), one student will type while others discuss and decide on what to type. It is not the typists' responsibility to figure out what to write, that is the responsibility of the mob.


### Student Presentations

On the final class date, you will give a presentation for your capstone project.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

In your presentations, you should first explain your application at a high level: what is your problem domain and what solution does your application present? Make it interesting. This is your first shot at capturing your audience's attention. 

Then, demo your application. Show its features and interact with its UI. 

Finally, explain the development process and the interesting parts of your code. How did you approach your solution? Highlight particularly unique or difficult portions of your code.

Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:

- What problem your application solve? What is the core function it performs?
- How did you go about planning?
- What major issues did you encounter during the course of development? How did you go about overcoming them?
- How did your vision for the project change over time?
- What part did you like the most? Least?
- What is the future of the project? What features (if any) will you work on next?
