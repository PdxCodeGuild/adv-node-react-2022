## Intro
The Node & React Full Stack Bootcamp is an intensive 11 week course that teaches dynamic web development using the **MERN** stack (**M**ongoDB/Mongoose, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact.js, and **N**ode.js). This course will guide you how to build reactive web applications using some of the industry’s most popular (and employable) technologies. 

### Prerequisites
Completion of the Python Full Stack Bootcamp or similar level of competency.
Competency can be shown as experience with at least one web framework and proficiency in basic web development (HTML/CSS/JS).

### Why the MERN stack?
The MERN stack is one of the most used tech stacks for web development. We chose this stack because it’s comprised of many sought after industry skills and because it’s great for developing a reactive dynamic web application. 

MERN is a set of open source tech that together provides an end-to-end framework:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database that stores your backend data as JSON documents
- **Express**: backend framework that runs atop Node
- **React.js**: reactive frontend framework
- **Node.js**: server-side JavaScript runtime environment that lets you implement your web app’s backend in JavaScript

The MERN stack is *isomorphic*, meaning it’s *all JavaScript*. Your entire project can be written in JavaScript, making writing code a seamless operation. 

### Why Node?
- As mentioned above it makes your server and client code isomorphic, meaning less technical debt for your developers
- Asynchronous I/O
  - This allows for lots of operations and connection in a single thread
- Popularity
- Lots of libraries to solve common problems
- Good package management
- Good community

### Why React?
- Speed
  - React is fast. It renders and re-renders your application very quickly, allowing for live updating, reactive apps
- Scalability 
  - React handles large programs with lots of complex updating data very well
- Modularity
  - React's component-based architecture breaks large applications into small components that are easy to build, debug, and test
- Popularity (employability)
- Good community
