# HTTP Servers

HTTP servers are programs that run on the internet, constantly listening for connections. They follow an idea called the **Request Response Cycle**, essentially a client asks for information from a server in the form of a request and returns a response which contains either what was asked for or an error.

You can read more about how the HTTP protocol works [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) and [here](https://www.clickminded.com/http-status-codes/).

*See the `Node` section of the `Modern Javascript` for an example of a simple HTTP server using node's standard library. We'll see more complex examples later using express.*
