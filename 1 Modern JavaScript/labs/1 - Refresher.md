# Lab 1: Refresher

**The goal of this lab is to cover the syntax of JavaScript in a platformless way, no browser and no server side stuff.**

*Remember you can always look at the docs!*

### Part 1

* Create an immutable variable called `name` and make it's value your name
* Create a mutable variable called `age` set it to your age.
* Increase the value of `age` by 1. 

### Part 2

* Create a function called `add` it should add 2 numbers together.
* Call that function and print the result.
* Create an anonymous function using `const` and the fat arrow syntax.
* Name it `hello` and have it print a message.
* Create another anonymous function called `isEven`, it should take in a number and return true if the number is even or false otherwise.

### Part 3

* Create an array of animals `['dog', 'cat', 'llama', 'bird']` as an immutable variable `animals`
* Iterate over animals and print each string uppercase.
* Remove the item `'cat'` from the array
* Add the item `'opossum'` to the array
* Get and remove the last value from `animals`

### Part 4

* Create a `class` called Point
* Inside it's constructor give it 2 attributes, `x` and `y`
* Write a method to find the distance between 2 points.
